//! A [`SharedMemory`] is identified by a name and allows two processes to share memory with each

//! One process creates the [`SharedMemory`] and multiple processes can then open the

//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```
//! use iceoryx2_cal::shared_memory::*;

//! use iceoryx2_bb_container::semantic_string::SemanticString;
//! use core::alloc::Layout;
//!
//! fn process_one<Shm: SharedMemory<PoolAllocator>>() {
//!     let shm_name = FileName::new(b"myShmName").unwrap();
//!     let allocator_config = pool_allocator::Config {
//!         // we want to allocate [`u64`]
//!         bucket_layout: Layout::new::<u64>()

//!     let shm = Shm::Builder::new(&shm_name).size(1024).create(&allocator_config).unwrap();
//!     let mut shm_pointer = shm.allocate(Layout::new::<u64>()).unwrap();
//!     unsafe { shm_pointer.data_ptr.write(123) };
