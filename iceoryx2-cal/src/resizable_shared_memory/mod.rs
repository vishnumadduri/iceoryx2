//! A [`ResizableSharedMemory`] is identified by a name and allows multiple processes to share
//! memory between them (inter-process memory). One process owns the [`ResizableSharedMemory`]
//! which can be created via the [`ResizableSharedMemoryBuilder`] and many processes can have a
//! [`ResizableSharedMemoryView`] that can be constructed via [`ResizableSharedMemoryViewBuilder`].
//!
//! The [`ResizableSharedMemoryView`] never owns the [`ResizableSharedMemory`] and has only
//! read-only access to it while the [`ResizableSharedMemory`] can use
//! [`ResizableSharedMemory::allocate()`] to acquire memory and distribute it between the
//! [`ResizableSharedMemoryView`]s.
//!
//! Whenever the [`ResizableSharedMemoryView`] receives an offset it must be registered via
//! [`ResizableSharedMemoryView::register_and_translate_offset()`] and unregistered via
//! [`ResizableSharedMemoryView::unregister_offset()`]. As soon as the [`ResizableSharedMemory`]
//! calls [`ResizableSharedMemory::deallocate()`] unused [`SharedMemory`] segments may be recycled.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```
